# QPID-demo
A demo of PID controller based on quantum computing

Time goes by. I decide to go back to my research :) This demo is a PID controller. Compared to the classical PID controller, I used the parameters of one Qubit which are mapped to Kp, Ki, and Kd.  This demo is initial. It can only control the DC motor. But it has some properties:
1. one-step iteration: After just one-step iteration, it will find the parameters.
2. the ability to track some complex signal, like sin, square and so on.
