# QPID-demo
A demo of PID controller based on quantum computing

This demo is a PID controller. Compared to the classical PID controller, I used Quantum Circuit to map the measurements  Kp, Ki, and Kd. 
In detail, this repository contains two implementations of a quantum-classical hybrid control system for BLDC motors:

## Main Branch (Full Implementation)
- Complete quantum state reconstruction
- PID parameters mapped from θ and φ:
  - P = (cos(θ) + 1)/2
  - I = φ/(2π)
  - D = cos(θ)
- Theoretical rigor with proven results

## Simplified Branch
- Direct measurement mapping
- Simplified quantum circuits
- More resource-efficient
- Equally effective control performance

Both implementations demonstrate successful BLDC motor speed control with:
- Fast response time
- Minimal overshoot
- Stable steady-state performance

Thanks to Claude 3.5, because this demo is partially generated by it.
