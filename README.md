# QPID-demo
A demo of PID controller based on quantum computing

This demo is a PID controller. Compared to the classical PID controller, I used a Quantum Circuit to map the measurements  Kp, Ki, and Kd. 
In detail, this repository contains two implementations of a quantum-classical hybrid control system for BLDC motors:

## Main Branch (Full Implementation) (Update 2025/5/6)
- Complete quantum state reconstruction
- PID parameters mapped from θ and φ:
  - P = (cos(θ) + 1)/2
  - I = φ/(2π)
  - D = cos(θ)
- Theoretical rigor with proven results
- **(Update 2025/5/6)Reconstruct the transformation function of the controller for Position Control:**\
  $$G(s) = \frac{K_p s^2 + K_i s + K_d}{C_1 s^2 + C_2 s + C_3}$$
  - Used another three Quantum Circuits to get C1, C2, and C3
- (Update 2025/5/6) Apply this controller to UR10e Robot arm in mujoco
- (Update 2025/5/6) Use DeepSeek to give instructions to control the arm by inputting natural language
  - Support joint angle input
  - Support the coordinate of the end effector (Inverse Kinematics)

## Simplified Branch
- Direct measurement mapping
- Simplified quantum circuits
- More resource-efficient
- Equally effective control performance

Both implementations demonstrate successful BLDC motor speed control with:
- Fast response time
- Minimal overshoot
- Stable steady-state performance

## (Update 2025/5/6)Requirement (This is my environment, probably you don't need the latest version)
- Python==3.12, Qiskit==1.4.0, mujoco==3.2.7, control=0.10.0

## (Update 2025/5/6)How to run
First
- Go to Deepseek's official website to get the API key: https://chat.deepseek.com/
Or alternatively,
- You can use other LLMs and modify the code.

Second
- Use console to run:
```markdown
    python run_main.py
```

This is the result of the response of the step signal.

This is the result of the response for end effector control.

Thanks to Claude 3.5, because this demo is partially generated by it.
