# QPID-demo
A demo of PID controller based on quantum computing

Time goes by. I decide to go back to my research :) This demo is a PID controller. Compared to the classical PID controller, I used the parameters of one Qubit which are mapped to Kp, Ki, and Kd.  This demo is initial. It can only control the DC motor. But it has some properties:
1. one-step iteration: After just one-step iteration, it will find the parameters.
2. the ability to track some complex signal, like sin, square and so on.

This is the result of the response of the step signal.

Thanks to Claude 3.5, because this demo is partially generated by it.
